    <h3>About Us</h3>
    <p>
      Welcome to shielded , where we are dedicated to protecting girls against
      Female Genital Mutilation(FGM) and Sexual Gender-Based Violence(SGBV). Our

      their rights and well-being. Our website provides resources and support to
      combat FGM, promote healthier rites of passage, and raise awareness about
      SGBV. Through education, empowerment, and community engagement, we aim to
      challenge harmful traditions, foster gender equality, and advocate for
      justice and prevention. Access our resources, learn about global
      initiatives, and join us in the fight against FGM and SGBV to create a
      safer and more equitable world for all girls.
    </p>
    <h3>Statements about FGM & SGBV</h3>
    <p>
      FGM is a harmful cultural practice involving the partial or total removal
      of female genitalia, leading to severe physical and psychological
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>
      SGBV encompasses various forms of violence targeting individuals based on
      their gender.
    </p>
    <p>
      Say no to FGM and join us in empowering girls to live a life fre from
      violence and harm.
    </p>
    <p>
      Breaking the silence surrounding FGM and SGBV is essential for ending
      these harmful practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Violence against women, particularly intimate partner violence and sexual
      violence, is a major public health problem and a violation of womenâ€™s
      human rights.
