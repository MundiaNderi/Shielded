      <h2>The Impact of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV)</h2>
      <p>Author: John Doe</p>
      <p>Date: June 20, 2023</p>
      <p>Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) and Sexual and Gender-Based Violence (SGBV) are serious human rights violations that affect millions of women and girls around the world. These harmful practices have severe physical, psychological, and social consequences.</p>
      <p>FGM involves the partial or total removal of female genitalia for non-medical reasons. It is often performed on young girls without their consent, leading to excruciating pain, infections, complications during childbirth, and long-term psychological trauma. FGM is deeply rooted in cultural beliefs, but it is important to recognize that it violates the rights of girls and women to bodily integrity and freedom from violence.</p>
      <p>SGBV refers to any form of violence that is perpetrated against individuals based on their gender or sex. It includes sexual assault, rape, domestic violence, harassment, and forced marriages. SGBV affects both women and men, but women and girls are disproportionately affected.</p>
      <p>These forms of violence create a cycle of fear and perpetuate gender inequality. They prevent women and girls from fully participating in society, accessing education, and realizing their full potential. It is crucial to raise awareness, promote education, and work towards ending FGM and SGBV.</p>
      <p>Efforts are being made globally to combat these issues. International organizations, governments, and grassroots movements are working together to raise awareness, provide support services for survivors, and advocate for legal reforms to protect women and girls.</p>
      <p>By joining this movement, we can all contribute to creating a world where FGM and SGBV are eradicated, and everyone can live free from violence and discrimination.</p>
