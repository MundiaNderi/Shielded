                  #SHIELDED
Redefining what innocence and dignity means to girls.

#Our Challenge statement
Girls in FGM-prone societies have their innocence taken away from them from the tender age of 8 years. This API seeks to provide shield to girls from FGM and SGBV by providing access to shelter houses, emergency ambulance/medicine, airtime, and information via USSD and our website.

This project will not solve and doesnâ€™t seek to solve the poverty that these girls live in. Nonetheless by rescuing these girls and setting them up in places where they can achieve education as opposed to early marriage and FGM, that outcome is achieved in the longrun.
