Our project’s main intention is to create awareness against SGBV and FGM and provide help to those affected by them. This project will not solve and and doesn’t seek to solve the poverty that these girls live in.

### WHY SHIELDED
SGBV and FGM is something that is affecting our countries till today. Hearing multiple stories on News channel of girls forced to undergo such vile acts under the excuse of tradition was one of the reasons for picking this project.
We also believe that educated girls play a vital role in driving social and econmic development. When girls recieve an eduction,they contribute to the workforce,drive innovation and foster economic growth.
